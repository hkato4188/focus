## How it Works

- The app utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The button triggers an animation that grows and shrinks a black dot in the center of the screen.
- Between inhales and exhales, there is a short pause of a random duration (between 0 and 3 seconds).
- The animation continues for a total duration of 1 minute.
- After completing the exercise, the button allows you to restart the process.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the app.
- `styles.css`: The stylesheet defining the app's visual styles.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the breathing exercise.
